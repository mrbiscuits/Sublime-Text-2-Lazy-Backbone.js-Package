# Lazy [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) Sublime Text 2 snippets for tab completion. @ version 1.0.0 of Backbone.js

Created by Phillip Whisenhunt.

Currently only supports JavaScript, but feel free to contribute Coffee Script.

###General

These snippets are auto generated from backbonejs.org because I got tired of updating these snippets with every new release of Backbone.js.

All snippets can be accessed by typing b*, where star is either:

- c for collection
- m for model
- r for router
- e for event
- h for history
- u for utility
- s for sync
